# smooth-white-theme

I wanted a theme that looks close to ink on paper and this is my attempt at creating an almost monochrome theme with a splash of color but without becoming a color-soup.

**Note that this is very much a work in progress and things may change drastically at any point until I got something I'm happy with**
